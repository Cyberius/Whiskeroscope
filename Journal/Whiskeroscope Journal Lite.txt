Micro motion amplitude seems smaller than last time.  Powering with external supply at 6V.  Running micro actuator from Abhi's laptop.  Had to install port driver.
Sample rate 100000.  Averaging 100 samples.  Software struggles to cope with file logging speed.
Bought guitar wire and glue.  The guitar wire looks perfect for a new whisker.  Bent and cut whisker to length.  No hot glue left.
To do:
1) Make guitar string whisker
2) Change software to log to memory instead

New front end that collects log in memory to save when finished.  Results look good.
Initial bug in setting reference.  Fixed later on.
Brought hot glue gun.  Made new whisker.  Works great.
Tried smart buffer allocation.  Didn't make much difference.
We found that 100Hz causes sensor clipping at a sweet spot when barely making contact.
Motor short, but fixed.
Looked at some signal processing.  Normalized raw data, subtracted two sensors and did frequency plot.  Showed some information in the frequency domain.

Abhi doing further data processing/analysis.  Envelope detection.  Plotting envelope amplitude against sensor amplitude clearly shows difference between samples with/without tape.
Added micro motion frequency sweep and amplitude control.  Now takes commands "f<frequency>", "a<amplitude>", "s<sweep freq target> <sweep rate>"
Collected various sweep samples with/without tape and with thumb.  Used various forces.

Testing real samples and reviewing last week's sweeps.
