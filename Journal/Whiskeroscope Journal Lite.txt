Micro motion amplitude seems smaller than last time.  Powering with external supply at 6V.  Running micro actuator from Abhi's laptop.  Had to install port driver.
Sample rate 100000.  Averaging 100 samples.  Software struggles to cope with file logging speed.
Bought guitar wire and glue.  The guitar wire looks perfect for a new whisker.  Bent and cut whisker to length.  No hot glue left.
To do:
1) Make guitar string whisker
2) Change software to log to memory instead
